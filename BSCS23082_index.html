    My name is Bilal Haroon and I have a background in computer science. I am passionate to learn new skills to become better and increase my knowledge which could help me in the near future. My life philosophy is “With hard work and dedication you could achieve anything.” I believe that we should push ourselves and be fully motivated to complete the task at hand. It may seem a bit tough in the beginning but if you are devoted to that task you could achieve nearly anything. Moreover, we should keep an open mind and be curious to increase our problem solving and analytical skills. I believe in embracing challenges which could help in my personal development. Approaching each day with curiosity and an open mind could be really beneficial for you to overcome new problems and achieve your goals.
